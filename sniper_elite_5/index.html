      <h1>Sniper Elite 5</h1>
      <p class="help-explanation">
        In Sniper Elite 5 you have to shoot the EU-voters, and help the Brexit-voters make it to the end.
        You are equiped with a bolt-action sniper rifle, this means you have to re-chamber the bullet after each shot, which takes some time.
        You are able to scope in using your left mouse button, once you're in the scope you can shoot by pressing left mouse again.
        But watch out, you don't want to shoot the Brexit-voters (dressed in black), when you shoot one of them you have to restart the level.
        Also make sure the EU-Voters (dressed in green) don't make it to the end, if one of them does you will have to restart the level.
        Your goal is to reach the required amount of votes indicated by the progress bar on the right or the vote counter in the top left.
        If you successfully reach the required amount of votes you will pass the level and get one of the letters of 'brexit'.
        Get all 6 to win the game, note that the levels will get harder as you progress.
        People will start to move more quickly, spawm more frequently and you will need more votes to complete the level.
